# Banana Bread [^1]

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 Cups – Mashed Bananas (RIPE) – 345 grams – This is roughly 3 large bananas but use exactly 1 1/2 cups of mashed ripe bananas for the best results.
* 8 Tablespoons – Unsalted Butter (softened) – 115 grams
* 2 – Large Eggs – 114 grams – Not extra large or jumbo eggs.
* 1 Cup – White Granulated Sugar – 200 grams – If you want a slightly “richer” taste, you should use 1/2 cup of light brown sugar (packed) & 1/2 cup of white granulated sugar.
* 2 Cups – All Purpose Flour – 240 grams
* 1 Teaspoon – Vanilla Extract – 5 milliliters
* 1 Teaspoon – Baking Soda – 5 grams
* 1 Teaspoon – Baking Powder – 4 grams
* 1/2 Teaspoon – Salt – 3 grams
* Optional – 1 Cup – Chocolate Chips, Fresh Blueberries, Chopped Walnuts or Chopped Pecans
* Optional – 1 Teaspoon – Ground Cinnamon – 3 grams – Some people really like to add cinnamon, especially if their bananas are not super ripe.

Equipment Needed – Measuring cup & spoons, mixing bowl, long wooden spoon, 9 by 5 inch metal bread pan, oven mitts, silicon spatula, cooling rack and an oven.

## Instructions

* Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
* Mash bananas with a fork.
* Soften butter in a microwave. FYI – I semi-melt the butter for better mixability.
* Stir bananas, butter, eggs & sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Mix until fully blended.
* Mix in the remaining ingredients. Stir until the batter is fully mixed.
* Optional – If you want to enhance this “basic” easy banana bread, you can stir in 1 cup of your family’s favorite dessert ingredient (e.g. chocolate chips or chopped walnuts) after you have mixed the batter.
* Pour the finished batter into a nonstick bread pan. Smooth out the top of the batter within the bread pan.
* Bake in the oven for 65-70 minutes at 325 degrees F or until golden brown.
* Take out of oven and let the banana bread cool down in the bread pan for 10 minutes. Use oven mitts. Do not remove the banana bread from the bread pan during this 10 minute cool down period.
* After 10 minutes, remove the banana bread from the bread pan. Place the banana bread on a cooling rack in order to completely cool. This cool down may take 1-2 hours.

## Tips

* Use RIPE bananas for the best taste. Ripe bananas are soft and the exterior peel is yellow with many small black & brown spots. Hard yellow/green(ish) unripe bananas are too starchy and have much less banana flavor. FYI – Beautiful pure yellow bananas are not fully ripe!
* If you use UNRIPE bananas, your banana bread will taste bland!!!
* Make sure to use 3 large bananas (not 3 medium bananas). Otherwise, this easy banana bread might turn out to be a little dry.
* To reduce errors (e.g. potential moisture variability) when making this easy banana bread recipe, you should use EXACTLY 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas. This will help prevent banana bread problems (e.g. the banana bread being too dry or too wet).
* Emergency tip – If you have less than 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas, you can add a little milk to the measuring cup until you reach the 1 1/2 cup level.
* FYI – In general, 3 medium-sized bananas equal roughly 1 to 1 1/4 cups of mashed bananas (not sliced bananas). 3 large-sized bananas equal roughly 1 1/3 to 1 2/3 cups of mashed bananas (not sliced bananas). Of course, banana sizes can vary greatly… and my version of medium and large-sized bananas may differ from yours!
* Emergency Tip 2 – If your bananas are not fully ripe, you can add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to this recipe. The use of unripe bananas results in a bland banana bread and the cinnamon helps to combat this “blandness”.
* This recipe is designed for making ONE banana bread. If you try to double the recipe, you are more likely to experience potential problems such as requiring longer baking times (if baking 2 banana breads at the same time), one pan potentially having more batter than the other pan (thus one banana bread baking faster than the other), etc.
