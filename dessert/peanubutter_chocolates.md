# Peanut Butter Chocolates[^1]

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
* 1 cup confectioners’ sugar
* 3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
* 3/4 cup (about 6 ounces) peanut butter
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/4 teaspoon salt, optional and to taste
* 1/4 cup chopped pecans, if necessary or desired
* about 8 ounces chopped chocolate or as needed, melted (see item 1. in the Notes and Tips below)
* holiday sprinkles, as needed

## Instructions

1. To a large bowl, add the melted butter, confectioners’ sugar, graham cracker crumbs, peanut butter, vanilla, optional salt, and stir to combine. Depending on how dry your mixture is, you may not need to add the pecans, but play it by ear. If the mixture is on the wet side, definitely add them and/or add additional graham cracker crumbs.
2. Using a 1-inch cookie scoop (highly recommended for ease and speed), scoop out approximately 48 equal-sized balls, and place them on a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Roll each between your palms to smooth them out and compact them.
3. Set aside in the fridge while you chop and melt the chocolate. I place the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 15 seconds bursts until it can be stirred smooth; use a double boiler if you prefer.
4. Using two forks or a toothpick, dip each ball in chocolate, shaking off the excess, and place on the parchment. Repeat until all balls have been dipped.
5. Evenly sprinkle the balls with sprinkles, to taste.
6. Allow chocolate to set up at room temperature or place the baking sheet in the fridge to speed it up.
