# Butter Chicken[1]
Cooking Equipment:

Roasting pan or sheet pan
Large pot (8-quart)
Spice grinder (optional)
Blender or immersion blender
Cooking thermometer
Ingredients
For the Garam Masala Spice*

2 each black cardamom pods
2 each green cardamom pods
1 tablespoon fenugreek
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon cumin seed
2 tablespoons coriander seed
2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon pepper
1 tablespoon ginger powder
2 tablespoons turmeric

*Note: Garam masala can be purchased at many grocery stores and Indian markets.

Over medium heat, combine all spices in sauté pan. Heat and toast spices for 30 to 45 seconds until they begin to pop. Let cool.

Using a spice grinder (an electric coffee-bean grinder, cleaned, can also work), grind spices into a fine powder (similar to black pepper). Store extra spice blend in an airtight container for up to one month.
Yogurt Marinade for Chicken

2 lbs. chicken thighs, preferably boneless and skinless
1/2 cup Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons garam masala spice blend
1 tablespoon ginger (grated)
2 teaspoons kosher salt
4 each cloves garlic (grated)
Butter Sauce

2 tablespoons canola oil
1 cinnamon stick
2 Indian red chiles (arbol)
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons grated ginger
2 tablespoons garlic
2 tablespoons garam masala
28 ounces canned tomatoes, chopped
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoons chopped cilantro for garnish

 
To prepare

Cut chicken thighs into 3/4 inch cubes. Combine yogurt, ginger, salt, garlic, and garam masala. Add cubed chicken thighs and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, overnight for better flavor.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove chicken from marinade, place in roasting pan and roast chicken for 10 to 12 minutes or until internal chicken temperature reaches approximately 150°F.

Gather all butter-sauce ingredients. Using large pot, over medium heat, heat canola oil. When hot, add cinnamon stick, bay leaves, red chiles, grated ginger and garlic. Cook for 30 seconds. Stir in garam masala and cook for 30 seconds. Add chopped tomatoes, and simmer for 20 minutes. Turn off heat, remove cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and chiles.

Use an immersion blender or a regular blender, blending in small batches, to purée the sauce until smooth. Once blended, return pot to low heat, and continually stir in cream and butter until sauce is incorporated.

Add the roasted chicken to the butter sauce pot. Stir often and cook until chicken temperature reaches 165°F.

Serve with basmati rice and naan; garnish with chopped cilantro. Bon Appétit!
