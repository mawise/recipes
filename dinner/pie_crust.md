# Pie Crust[^1]

## Ingredients

 - 2 cups, plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 2/3 cup cold shortening or if you prefer, substitute cold butter, cut into Â½-inch pieces, for half of the shortening.
 - 6 to 8 tablespoons ice-cold water

## Steps

1. Make Pastry: Mix flour and salt in medium bowl. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender or fork, until mixture forms coarse crumbs the size of small peas. Sprinkle with the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost leaves side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added, if necessary).
2. Chill Pastry: Gather pastry into ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap rounds in plastic wrap and refrigerate 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly at room temperature before rolling.
3. Roll Out Bottom Crust: Using floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round on lightly floured surface into a round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate.
4. Transfer Pastry to Pie Plate: Fold pastry into fourths and place in pie plate or roll pastry loosely around rolling pin and transfer to pie plate or tart pan. Unfold or unroll pastry and ease into plate or pan, pressing firmly against bottom and side and being careful not to stretch pastry, which will cause it to shrink when baked.
5. Fill Crust: Spoon desired filling into bottom crust. Trim overhanging edge of bottom crust 1/2 inch from rim of plate.
6. Roll Out Top Crust: Roll other round out. Fold into fourths and place over filling; or roll loosely around rolling pin and place over filling. Unfold or unroll pastry over filling. Cut slits in pastry so steam can escape.
7. Flute Edge: Trim overhanging edge of top pastry 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold edge of top crust under bottom crust, pressing on rim to seal; flute edges. Bake as directed in desired pie recipe.
