# Stuffed Portobelos [1]

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup quinoa 
* 1/3 cup chopped roasted almonds 
* 3 scallions, thinly sliced and white and green parts separated 
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 
* 4 large or 8 small portobello mushrooms, stems discarded 
* 4 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling 
* 1/2 cup crumbled Feta (2 ounces) 
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
* 5 ounces mixed greens (6 cups) 
* 1/2 English cucumber, thinly sliced

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 400° F. Cook the bulgur according to the package directions; transfer to a medium bowl and let cool to room temperature. Stir in the almonds, scallion whites, thyme, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
2. Meanwhile, place the mushrooms on a rimmed baking sheet, rub with 2 tablespoons of the oil, and season with ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper. Roast, stem-side up, until tender, 18 to 20 minutes.
3. Top the mushrooms with the bulgur mixture and sprinkle with the Feta, dividing evenly. Roast until warmed through, 2 to 4 minutes more.
4. Whisk together the lemon juice, the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the greens and cucumber and toss to combine.
5. Drizzle the mushrooms with olive oil, sprinkle with the scallion greens, and serve with the salad.
