# Buttermilk Pancakes

## Ingredients

* 1⅓ cups (167g) all-purpose flour [or 1 ¼ cups (156g) whole wheat flour]
* 3 tablespoons (36g) sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1¼ cups buttermilk (or 1 cup milk, ¼ cup vinigar, let sit ~10 min)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
* Vegetable oil (for griddle)
* Pure maple syrup (for serving)

## Directions

### Step 1

Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk eggs, buttermilk, and butter in a medium bowl; stir into dry ingredients until just combined (some lumps are okay).

### Step 2

Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium; brush with oil. Working in batches, scoop ⅓-cupfuls of batter onto griddle. Cook pancakes until bottoms are golden brown and bubbles form on top, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through and other side of pancakes are golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Serve pancakes with maple syrup.
